\section{Conclusion}

Despite the fact that the model used is extremely simple, it captures the essence of the physics involved. The simulations show that the particles are trapped in helical trajectories following the field lines, exactly as one would predict using electromagnetic theory. Moreover, a drift of the trajectories around the equator is observed for sufficiently large initial velocities, as is also predictable from theory.

\section{Conclusion}

Despite the fact that the model used is extremely simple, it captures the essence of the physics involved. The plots show that the particles are trapped in helical trajectories following the field lines, exactly as one would predict using electromagnetic theory. 

Moreover, through modifying the parameters of the model slightly, the particles are shown to be spiralling in towards the poles. This is in accordance with the fact that the Aurora is observed here. However, this rather flimsily demonstrated fact is not based on a careful enough analysis, as special relativity starts playing an important role when the energy of the particles increases.
